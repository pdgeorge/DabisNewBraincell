# TODO
- Make every hard coded string paramatisable. "Read from file and get the value there"
- Update "moderator" queue so it is not just myself
- Add a better game than just "TIME OUT YOUR FRIENDS!" (You know the game you want to make)
- Move full_timeout_user out of bot_openai over to twitch_wrappers. Rename to timeout_user
