# Dablings
## MVP
* Decouple twitch_event.py from queues
  * Move towards... File? Redis DB?
* Channel point redeem for TTS from chat
  * Channel point redeem will cause message to be read out aloud
  * Static Dabling will pop up and 'read' out the TTS then drop back down
* Launch dabling.py from main.py

## Next goals
* Move "login count" to Dabling away from SAMMI
* Dabling has chatters name on chest
* Feed Dabling redeem
  * Redeemers Dabling pops up, food drops in mouth
* Different Dabling based on login count
  * Dabling has chatters "login count" on chest as first step
* Dabling 'wants to be fed'

## Stages of growth
* Baby (Adorable AF) (0-10)
* Teen (Punk?) (11-19)
* Young Adult (Hipster? Latte, styled moustache, ironic shirt?) (20-30)
* GigaDabi (SWOLE) (31-40)
* Eldercorn (Elder, wrinkly, plus walking stick) (41+)
* Prestige (41+ optional to go back)
  * Find a way to have your Dabling be 0 but your login count remain high?
    * A table? Dabi#Dablings: User | LoginCount | DablingLevel | Accessories
